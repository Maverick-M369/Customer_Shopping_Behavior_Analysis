**📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**

**A Data Analytics Portfolio Project by Muddassir Mushtaq Mulla**

**🌟 Project Summary (Recruiter-Friendly)**

This project showcases my ability to analyze real-world customer behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present insights professionally via a Gamma AI-generated PPT.

I worked with a dataset of 3,900 retail transactions to uncover key insights related to:

Customer demographics

Shopping habits

Discount-driven purchases

Subscription behavior

Product performance

This project reflects my skills in data cleaning, business analysis, SQL KPI derivation, and dashboard creation, making it ideal for roles in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, or Data Science.

**📂 Dataset Overview**

Total Records: 3,900
Total Features: 18

Data Includes:

Customer Info: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status

Purchase Details: Product, Category, Season, Amount, Shipping Type

Behavioral Data: Discounts, Promo codes, Reviews, Previous Purchase History

**Data Quality Notes**

37 missing values in review_rating

Slight overlap between discount and promo fields

**🧹 EDA & Data Cleaning (Python)**

Performed in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and NumPy.

**Key Steps:**

Loaded dataset and inspected structure (df.info() & df.describe())

Filled missing review ratings using median per category

Standardized column names (snake_case)

Cleaned categorical values for consistency

Derived:

age_group

purchase_frequency_days

Removed redundant promo_code_used column

Uploaded cleaned dataset to PostgreSQL for further analysis

**🛢️ KPI & Business Insights (SQL)**

Executed on PostgreSQL using advanced SQL techniques including aggregations and window functions.

KPIs & Insights Extracted:

Revenue comparison by gender

High-spending customers who still used discounts

Top 5 products by average rating

Shipping type spending differences

Subscriber vs. non-subscriber revenue comparison

Discount-dependent products

Customer segments: New, Returning, Loyal

Top 3 products in each category

Subscription likelihood for repeat buyers

Revenue contribution by age groups

These KPIs directly address business questions around profitability, customer retention, and marketing strategy.

**📊 Power BI Dashboard**

Created a multi-page interactive dashboard including:

Overall Revenue & Sales KPIs

Age & Gender Demographics

Subscription revenue impact

Shipping behavior analysis

Discount influence on purchase behavior

Category & product performance visuals

This dashboard turns raw data into actionable insights for business decision-makers.

**📽️ Presentation (Gamma AI)**

To enhance storytelling and communication, I created a professional presentation using Gamma AI, summarizing:

The business problem

Analysis workflow

KPIs & SQL findings

Power BI visual insights

Final recommendations

This demonstrates my ability to communicate data insights clearly and professionally—an essential skill for analysts.

**💡 Business Recommendations**

Based on the full analysis, I proposed the following:

1. Encourage More Subscriptions

Offer exclusive benefits such as free express shipping and member-only deals.

2. Build a Loyalty Program

Reward returning customers, especially those with 5+ purchases.

3. Optimize Discount Strategy

Review products with heavy discount dependency to protect margins.

4. Promote High-Rated Products

Use customer feedback and ratings in marketing campaigns.

5. Target High-Revenue Age Groups

Prioritize advertising toward the most profitable customer segments.

6. Improve Delivery Experience

Introduce express-shipping perks for high-value or loyal customers.
